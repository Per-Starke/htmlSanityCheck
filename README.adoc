== About
kbd:[HtmlSC] can perform various content and semantic checks on HTML files,
e.g. check for missing images, broken internal links, duplicate targets etc.

It can be helpful in case of html generated from e.g. {asciidoc-url}[Asciidoctor],
Markdown or other formats - as converters usually don't check for missing images
or broken links.

It can be used as Gradle plugin or as standalone Java/Groovy app. A simple UI
is planned for a future release.
